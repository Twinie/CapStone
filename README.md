# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
I have tried to create an asynchronous web app with the instructions given that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

## Instructions
Use `npm install` to install project dependencies. I have modified the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file as required.

## Extras
 I have used this as my web API url reference taken from openWeatherMap.com and the mail received from the URL for the API Key = api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?zip={zip code}&appid={API key}
