# CAPSTONE Project

## Overview
I have built a Travel App that obtains a desired trip location and visiting date from the user which needs to be within 16 days. With this information from the user, I have displayed Country, Latitude, Longitude, weather and an image of the location using information obtained from external APIs. 

## Instructions
I have set up the local storage. The trip location and the date will be displalyed on UI as the information is saved on the local storage and the local storage can cleared also once the clear list button is clicked. 


## Extras
The files and folders are placed as per the required format.
Jest has been installed and I have tested the get city function.
